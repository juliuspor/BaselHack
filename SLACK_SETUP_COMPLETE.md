# ✅ Slack Setup Complete!

Your Slack credentials have been incorporated into the application.

## 🔐 Credentials Configured

```
Client ID: YOUR_SLACK_CLIENT_ID
Client Secret: YOUR_SLACK_CLIENT_SECRET
Bot Token: xoxb-YOUR-BOT-TOKEN
App Token: xapp-YOUR-APP-TOKEN (for Socket Mode)
```

✅ Stored in: `/code/.env`
✅ Configured in: `docker-compose.yml`
✅ Backend updated to use bot token

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Restart Docker (Required!)

```bash
cd /Users/jporbeck/Desktop/BaselHack/code
docker-compose down
docker-compose up
```

### 2. Test Slack Integration

1. Open your app: http://localhost:5173
2. **Create New Project**
3. Step 2: Click "Connect" on Slack
   - Should show **"Connected"** immediately (no OAuth needed!)
4. Step 3: Design your campaign
5. Click **"Launch Campaign"**
6. 🎉 Your message will post to Slack!

## 🎯 How It Works Now

### Smart Connection Detection

The app now checks for connections in this order:

1. **Pre-configured bot token** (✅ YOU HAVE THIS!)
   - No OAuth popup needed
   - Shows "Connected" immediately
   - Just click "Connect" to select it

2. **OAuth flow** (fallback)
   - If no bot token
   - Opens popup for authorization
   - Stores token in `/data/oauth_tokens.json`

### Message Posting

When you launch a campaign:
- Uses your **bot token** automatically
- Posts to the `general` channel by default
- Can customize channel later

## 📝 Important Notes

### Channel Permissions

Your bot needs to be invited to channels before it can post:
1. Go to your Slack workspace
2. Open the channel (e.g., `#general`)
3. Type `/invite @Harmony` (or your bot name)
4. Now the bot can post there!

### What's in `.env`

```env
SLACK_CLIENT_ID=your_slack_client_id
SLACK_CLIENT_SECRET=your_slack_client_secret
SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-your-bot-token
SLACK_APP_TOKEN=xapp-your-app-token
```

### Security

- ✅ `.env` is in `.gitignore` (not committed)
- ✅ Tokens stored securely
- ✅ Docker containers have access via environment variables

## 🧪 Quick Test

Test the bot directly via Slack API:

```bash
curl -X POST https://slack.com/api/chat.postMessage \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SLACK_BOT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "channel": "general",
    "text": "Hello from Harmony! 🎵"
  }'
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "not_in_channel" Error
→ Invite the bot to the channel: `/invite @Harmony`

### "Connected" but messages don't post
→ Check backend logs: `docker-compose logs -f backend`

### Environment variables not loading
→ Make sure you ran `docker-compose down` before `up`

## 📊 What's Different Now

**Before:** Users had to complete OAuth flow every time

**After:** 
- Slack shows "Connected" immediately ✅
- Just click to select it
- Launch campaigns → messages post instantly
- No popup needed!

## 🎉 You're All Set!

Your Slack bot is **fully configured** and ready to post messages. Just restart Docker and test it out!

## 🔜 Add Discord (Optional)

Want to add Discord too? Just fill in these in `.env`:

```env
DISCORD_CLIENT_ID=your_discord_client_id
DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET=your_discord_client_secret
```

Then restart Docker and it'll work the same way!
